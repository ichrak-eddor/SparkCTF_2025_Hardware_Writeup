This challenge provides a **sCPPy.sal** file, which is a capture from a **Saleae logic analyzer**. You can check it out here: <>

## Step 1: Identifying the Protocol

When analyzing logic analyzer captures, the first step is to determine which communication protocol is in use.

Looking at the signals, we notice that **only Channel 4** has meaningful activity, while the other channels appear to be just noise.

This suggests that the communication is using **UART protocol**, and our next step is to determine the **correct baud rate**.

## Step 2: Finding the Baud Rate

Observing the signal on Channel 4, we can see different messages being sent at varying **timing, length, and frequency**.

To identify the baud rate, we measure the **bit duration** of the signal, as baud rate is inversely related to bit duration.

### First Bit Duration

By analyzing the waveform, we find that the first message has a **bit duration of 418.5 Âµs**.

Now, we check which standard baud rate corresponds to a bit duration close to **418.5 Âµs**.

After testing, we successfully decode the second message.

### Second Bit Duration

For the next message, the measured bit duration is **4.5 Âµs**, which corresponds to a **baud rate of 230400**.

Decoding it gives us the first part of the message:

Third Bit Duration

Another message appears with a **bit duration of 52.25 Âµs**, which matches a **baud rate of 19200**.

Decoding it gives us the final message.

## Step 3: Extracting the Flag

Once all messages are collected, we see that they form a **link**:

Opening this **Wokwi project**, we find a circuit with an **OLED display** running a code that displays images.

Given that the challenge is named **sCPPy** (with "CPP"), and the description hints at looking for an **image**, we suspect a **bitmap-to-C++ conversion** is involved.

Looking at the code, we notice a **hidden section**:

```arduino
arduino
CopyEdit
const uint8_t  bitmap_icon_speed[] PROGMEM = {
	 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x77, 0x6e, 0x45, 0x44, 0x75, 0x64, 0x15, 0x45, 0x77, 0x45, 0x00, 0x05,
	 0x00, 0x00, 0x58, 0x10, 0x49, 0xd0, 0x59, 0x50, 0x49, 0x54, 0x19, 0xde, 0x00, 0x04, 0x00, 0x00
};

```

Using an **image-to-C++ decoder** like https://javl.github.io/image2cpp/, we **decode the bitmap**.

Since we know it's a **16x16 pixel** image, we extract the final flag:
